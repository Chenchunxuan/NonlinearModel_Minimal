This folder contains the data required to run the DLM software for the BFF aircraft.

1. aeroGridData_v01.mat: Contains information on the panels and nodes of the aerodynamic grid,                          it is generated using GridData.m script inside the 'gridding' folder.

2. AircraftData_v01.mat: It contains aircraft mass properties and geometry information

3. GAM_data_v01.mat: It contains the matrices required to generate the generalized                      aerodynamics matrices. This file is generated using GAM_matrices.mat                      located in the GAM_matrices_BFF folder. 

4. strucDynData_v01.mat: It contains information obtained from the structural model, this file                          is generated using the Finite Element tools
