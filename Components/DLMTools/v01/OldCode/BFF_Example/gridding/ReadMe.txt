This folder contains scripts for creating panels for the BFF\miniMUTT aircraft. The folder mainly has 2 scripts:

1. BFFdrawing
   
   This script is used for generating the outline of the BFF, which can then be used as a base for generating panels.  


2. GridData.m

   This function generates the panels and their associated information as required by the DLM code, based on the outline provided by BFFdrawing().
